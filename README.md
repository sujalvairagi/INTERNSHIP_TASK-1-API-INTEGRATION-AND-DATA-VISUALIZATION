Weather Dashboard Project

This is a Python project that shows current weather information for 5 cities in India: Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, and Pune. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data and displays the results in the form of graphs.

What the project does:

- Connects to OpenWeatherMap and collects real-time weather data
- Stores the data like temperature, humidity, and condition in a table using pandas
- Shows the data using four graphs in one dashboard window

Graphs included:

1. A bar graph showing the temperature of each city
2. A line graph comparing actual temperature vs feels-like temperature
3. A bar graph showing humidity in each city
4. A pie chart showing the type of weather condition in each city (like clear, cloudy, etc.)

Libraries used:

- requests
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

How to run the project:

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system
2. Install the required libraries if not already installed:

   pip install requests pandas matplotlib seaborn

3. Add your OpenWeatherMap API key in the code
4. Run the Python file in your editor or terminal

Important Notes:

- The API gives live data so the output may vary each time
- Make sure you have an internet connection while running the script
- This project is created as part of an internship task based on API integration and data visualization

This project helped me understand how to work with APIs, store data using pandas, and visualize data using different types of plots in Python.
